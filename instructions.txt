Make sure the pi is connected to the phone as a wifi hotspot. 
Use "hostname -I" on the pi to see what IP addresses it's using, update the app to use the one it's hosting the website on.
You should be able to visit the website on any device connected to the phone as wifi hotspot (including phone) by going to [that IP addr]:8080. 
When ssh'd into the pi, use tmux to handle different 'tabs'.
In tmux, use ctrl+b then : then enter split-window to make 2 tabs. Switch between them with ctrl+b then o. 
Run python3 ~/cherrypy/project.py in one tab and sudo python scan.py in the other tab. 

Debugging:
Is the app trying to open the correct site? Use android studio log messages to see what it's trying to open 
Is the site being hosted? Using a device connected to the phone's wifi hotspot, enter [that IP address]:8080 (without http before it) to see.
